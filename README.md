Development:

Before starting the project, I wrote out the requirements with details and
divided the work into 4 days. I made my wire frames on index cards and
mapped out what I wanted each section to look like. I used class notes, recordings,
and google to help guide me with sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. I
needed extra 1:1 help with making a new game and updating a game. I realized I
was not understanding what I was typing in code so then I started to write down
what I wanted in my own words then tried to translate that into code. I was able to
complete my tic-tac-toe game with the extra time given and with some help and
feedback from classmates.

Unsolved problems:

During the game I would like to highlight X or O depending on whose turn it is.
For styling I want to add images, patterns, and sound.
