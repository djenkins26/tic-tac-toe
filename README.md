I used:
HTML/css
Javascript
jquery
bootstrap


Before starting the project, I wrote out the requirements with details and
divided the work into 4 days. I made my wire frames on index cards and
mapped out what I wanted each section to look like. I used class notes, recordings,
and google to help guide me with sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. I
needed extra 1:1 help with making a new game and updating a game. I realized I
was not understanding what I was typing in code so then I started to write down
what I wanted in my own words then tried to translate that into code.

During the game I would like to highlight X or O depending on whose turn it is.
I still need to add who won, loss, or tie when the game is over and to add a play
again option when game is over. I am also missing a signed in user that can view
the number of games played. For styling I want to add iamges and patterns
eventhough it is not a requirement. 

user stories:

As a user I want to sign up and sign in
As a user I want to start a new game of tic tac toe
As a user I want to be able to change my password
As a user I want to click inside the box with an X or O

As a user I want to be able to see number of games played
As a user I want to play a new game or sign out when a game is over
